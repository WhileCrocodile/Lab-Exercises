            <p>=============================================</p>
            <p>Welcome to the <b>Temple of Baba</b>, where we teach you all about the wonderful characters of <i>Baba is You.</i></p>

            <h4>But what is Baba is You?</h4>
            <p><i>Baba is You</i> is a puzzle game released in 2019 by developer Arvi Teikari.</p>
            <p> In it, you solve puzzles by pushing around words to make statements and sentences, and use that to your advantage to win levels.</p>
            <p>Here's a simple video example of a level:</p>
            <video width="640" height="360" controls>
                <source src="baba_example.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <p>If you want to know more about the game, you can read more about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You">Wikipedia</a>, or check out the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/">Steam</a>.</p>
            <p>But enough about the gameplay, lets talk about all of the animals!</p>

            <h2>Baba (the main character)</h2>
            <p><i>Scientific name: Felis babicus</i></p>
            <img src="baba_sprite.webp" alt="An image of Baba." width="100">
            <p>This is Baba, the main character of the game. It likes to push things around, oftentimes randomly! Sometimes it solves the puzzles, sometimes it doesn't. But trust me, it's more clever than it seems!</p>
            <p>... Most of the time.</p>
            <video width="640" height="360" controls>
                <source src="baba_no.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <p>It seems it's just like a cat, always pushing things that shouldn't be pushed...</p>
            <p>Speaking of pushing things, here's a random button that does nothing of consequence. Push it as much as you'd like.</p>
            <input type="button" value="Push me!">
            <p>Okay, let's move on!</p>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Keke (the other main character)</h2>
            <p><i>Scientific name: Homo keepiens</i></p>
            <img src="keke_sprite.webp" alt="An image of Keke" width="100">
            <p>This is Keke! I'm not actually quite sure what it is. It kind of looks like a jellybean grew legs and eyes? Whatever it may be, don't be fooled by its simple appearance!</p>
            <p> You can often find him solving puzzles by himself, or working with Baba to crack puzzles that they can't solve alone.</p>
            <p>Also, here's a haiku about Keke, because I can't find any other excuse to use the &lt;br&gt; element.</p>
            <p><i>A mysterious<br>orange bean, solving puzzles.<br>Baba's companion.</i></p>
            <p>What a majestic creature. Nature is amazing.</p>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Ghost (just a random ghost?)</h2>
            <p><i>Scientific name: Phasma spookicus</i></p>
            <img src="ghost_sprite.webp" alt="An image of a ghost" width="100">
            <p>It's a ghost! It's just kind of floating there... menacingly.</p>
            <p>You can often find it loitering in various levels, and wandering in different directions. Sometimes it's helpful, sometimes it's not. Many puzzles in <i>Baba is You</i> involve creatively working around the obstacles presented by the ghost, or finding ways to use it to your advantage.</p>
            <p>Remember, ghosts are friends, so don't be scared! Well... they're friends most of the time. Maybe be a little scared.</p>
            <p>Boo!</p>
